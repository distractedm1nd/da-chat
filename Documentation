"Privacy is the foundation of all freedoms. Arguing that you don't care about privacy because you have nothing
to hide is like saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say." - Edward Snowden

\\\\\WHAT IS DA-CHAT?\\\\\

DA-CHAT is a private messaging service that utilizes the Data Availability layer of Celestia Mainnet Beta 
to create chat "rooms" for which read/write access is controlled via a users public/private key pair.

A user who wants to create a "Room" generate a public/private key pair unique to that Room. The public/private
keys allow read and write access, respectively, within that Room.

By distributing the public/private keys to their friends and communities, users can rely on the cryptographic
security of the Celestia mainnet beta network to ensure that their conversations remain secure and private.
